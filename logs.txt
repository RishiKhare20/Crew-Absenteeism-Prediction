Monitoring Engine ---------->
There are 4146 crew members whos leave was predicted
789 crew members had first activity as leave
3357 crew members had first activity as non-leave
608 non-leave crew members were predicted as leave
52 leave crew members were predicted as non-leave
Therefore, total percentage correctly predicted: 84.08104196816208
