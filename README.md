# Crew-Absenteeism-Prediction

# Abstract
The Crew Absenteeism Prediction System is a data-driven platform solution that helps alleviate the operational   challenges arising from such unplanned workforce absences. Inappropriately managed workforce leads to disruptions, increased costs and productivity loss with absenteeism being critical concern for many organizations. Within this project, we use predictive analytics, and machine learning in order to predict absenteeism based on historical data and important influence factors, in order to empower the manager with   information and thus enabling him to make decision and to plan ahead for hiring needs. It seeks to facilitate more accurate predictions of potential absenteeism events so that companies can optimally allocate resources, minimize last-minute staffing costs, and keep operations stable. The platform also provides insights that can help identify patterns and root causes of absenteeism to improve employee well-being and job satisfaction clarity. The purpose of this report is to explain the process of prediction model building, what are the methods, data analysis and practical usage of predictive analytics within human resource management. This project is in line with SDG 8 on promoting sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

# Significance of the Project
It will essentially serve several aims of great importance in improving workforce productivity and organizational effectiveness. Sub objective one is model development; one of which is to create a model that has high predictive accuracy of the absenteeism pattern. With help of historical data, as well as the given factors influencing the rate of workforce shortage, the system will allow organizations to forecast the shortage in advance. Another important goal is the objective of proper resources distribution in organizations. With regard to business values, prediction of absenteeism saves managers time to staff appropriately and avoid last minute alteration of schedules hence cutting out costs. This way and only this way is it possible to prevent a range of problems and make sure that operations will progress without considerable interruptions. In the same regard the system has a goal of improving decision making as managers are presented with first-hand information and analysis of trends in absenteeism. It also empowers organisations to make intelligent workforce decisions to overcome any emerging issue before it gets out of hand. A predictive system remains beneficial for organizations of all sizes because it works well on large amounts of data and also can be easily updated when trends change or more data accumulates. When used appropriately, organisation can accurately predict the occurrence of absenteeism and in doing so adjust staffing plans, avoid disruptions and escalating costs, and provide for more consistent work environment.

# Conclusion
This project aims to proactively address and manage absenteeism by leveraging data-driven techniques. Through the integration of historical data, machine learning algorithms, and an intuitive user interface, the system provides actionable insights that help HR and management make informed decisions. Accurate predictions enable better workforce planning, reducing the impact of unexpected absenteeism on operations. Additionally, the system supports continuous model improvement, ensuring that predictions remain relevant and effective as new data is collected. Key benefits realized by the system include: improved operational efficiency, as when done right it assists in planning staff replacement, hence reducing disruptions; cost reduction, as effective management of staff absenteeism translates to fewer instances of employees contacting temporary workers or working overtime; data-driven decision making, where specific KPIs, main metrics, and other reports in change management provide a strong foundation for strategic decisions concerning human resources management; and enhanced workforce satisfaction, as understanding why employees miss work can help organizations with suggestions for promoting healthier and happier workers. In general, the system is an improvement in the effort toward enhancing workforce management systems in crew-based industries with the aim of enhancing productivity and organizational effectiveness.
